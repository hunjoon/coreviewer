Different from conventional UDA scenario, SF-UDA assumes that model adaptation of target domain only accesses well-trained source model without well-labeled source data. Overall, in my opinion, this work is only an experimental report instead of a complete research paper due to two main reasons.\n\n1. In Section \u201cMethod\u201d, the current manuscript only provided many details of the existing SF-UDA work (SHOT) without description of new proposed algorithm. Thus, this current version lacks a complete novel algorithm.\n\n2. Currently, there are a lot of explorations on SF-UDA topic [1, 2, 3]. However, the current work does not make fair comparisons with them. Thus, the experiments are not enough.\n\n[1] Chu, Tong, et al. \"Denoised maximum classifier discrepancy for source free unsupervised domain adaptation.\" Thirty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-22).
