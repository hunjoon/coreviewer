  "strength_and_weaknesses": "**Strength**\n\n1. It is interesting and novel to apply varying downsampling ratios across the same data instance to better extract the task-relevant information.\n\n2. The proposed method is extensively validated across several audio processing tasks, indicating its general effectiveness on audio processing.\n\n\n**Weakness**\n\n1. The major concern for the proposed method is its generality for 2D inputs like images, considering all the baselines, including spectral pooling and DiffStride, also work for 2D images. Intuitively the principles discussed in Section 3.1 can be applicable for 2D images but the alignment matrix A should be defined on 2D distances and the introduced computational overhead should be quite large. A discussion for such generality is expected, otherwise the proposed method is limited to sequential data and not so general as the baselines.\n\n2. Considering the fully connected layers in AdaStride are executed for each input token, this may incur larger overheads and limit the scalability of long sequences.\n\n3. The author analyzes that the spectral pooling is a better choice for the TUT dataset with high-frequency noises in Table 1. Although this is reasonable, I wonder whether the proposed AdaStride can be also applied in the frequency domain on top of spectral pooling for improving the accuracy on the TUT dataset.\n\n4. The WER improvements in Table 3 is limited. Experiments on low-resource speech, e.g., LibriSpeech-10h/100h, may lead to more extensive comparisons.\n\n5. The margins around figures and tables are sometimes too large, e.g., Table 3 and Figure 4, which can be better organized.\n\n\n\n\n",
  "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper proposes a new downsampling method for sequential data, which supports varying downsampling ratios across the same data instance. To achieve this, it rearranges each time step on a one-dimensional line segment, which is used to learn an alignment matrix for performing the downsampling. Extensive experiments across several audio processing tasks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
