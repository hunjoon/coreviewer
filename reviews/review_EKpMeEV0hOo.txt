  "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n+ (Clarity) The paper is very well organized and clearly written. The figures are also well made and very informative.\n+ (Novelty) The paper and its proposed techniques are novel as far as I can tell. The topic is clearly important (for its e.g. medical & health applications) yet doesn\u2019t seem to be as popularly studied as other ML/SSL topics. \n+ (Quality) The paper is of good quality in my opinion. The algorithm is well designed for periodic signals to maximally extract useful information (via frequency augmentation) to be better learned (via periodic feature similarity & generalized loss). The technical details are all correct as far as I can tell. The empirical evaluation is also comprehensive, covering 6 different SSL (and related) tasks against popular baselines, ~even though the selection of baselines could be further improved (see weaknesses).~\n+ (Significance) The proposed techniques are simple, easy to implement and experimentally highly effective, making the algorithm (SimPer) a strong, potentially impactful baseline for future researchers & practitioners to use and/or improve upon.\n\nWeaknesses\n- ~(Evaluation, Minor) The algorithm is currently only benchmarked against 4 SSL baselines and a supervised counterpart, not SOTA algorithms on each of the datasets (e.g. the MAE for Countix appears much weaker than Table 7 of Dwibedi et al.). While SimPer is likely orthogonal to those SOTA algorithms and thus might be applied jointly, it\u2019s still non-ideal to completely omit the SOTA baselines and the discussion on how SimPer could further boost the SOTA numbers.~",
  "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper presents SimPer, a simple yet effective SSL algorithm specifically designed for periodic tasks (e.g. heart rate estimation & exercise repetition counting through video data, temperature forecasting through satellite data). With the newly proposed techniques including periodicity-variant (i.e. input frequency) augmentation, periodic feature similarity, and generalized (weighted) contrastive loss, SimPer demonstrates impressive results in a large array of tasks including SSL (Table 2 to 7), fine-tuning (Table 8), low-shot learning (Fig 4), transfer learning (Table 9), zero-shot generalization (Table 10), robustness to spurious correlations (Fig 6), etc. against existing SSL algorithms (SimCLR, MoCo v2, BYOL and CVRL) and supervised training, on 6 datasets (2 synthetic) from 4 different domains."
