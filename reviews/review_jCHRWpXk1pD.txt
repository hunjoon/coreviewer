  "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strength\n\nThe paper considers federated learning with openset noisy labels, which may be practically useful. The proposed method is tested on both benchmark and real-world datasets and is shown to outperform baseline methods.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe first concern is about novelty. As peer loss is well studied in centralized label noise learning by Liu & Guo 2020 and Cheng et al., 2020, the main contribution of the current paper is to extend it to the federated learning setting which seems quite straightforward.\n\nAnother concern is about the convergence of the proposed method. As the proposed method contains multiple steps, e.g., initialization with $T_{DP}$ generation, label communication, loss evaluation on noisy data, and peer gradient updates, the rate of openset noise and the selection of $\\epsilon$ may inevitably affect training, how can we guarantee the convergence of proposed method?\n\nThe standard setup of federated learning is to train a model collectively from multiple parties without sharing each party's local data. The label communication step in FedPeer seems necessary to FedPeer but violates the standard federated setting. Could the authors provide some real-world examples of federated learning with openset noisy labels and justify label communication with the label privacy guarantee is enough?",
  "summary_of_the_paper": "This paper studies federated learning where the local data on each client are non-iid in the sense that they may encounter openset noisy labels. To solve the problem, they extend the so-called peer loss which is studied in centralized label noise learning to the federated learning scenario and call the proposed method FedPeer. They also test the FedPeer method on both benchmark and real-world datasets."
