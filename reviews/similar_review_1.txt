  "confidence_reasoning": "You are fairly confident in your assessment. It is possible that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work. Math/other details were not carefully checked.",
  "strength_and_weaknesses": "Strengths\n- This paper generalizes dropout to activation noise and studies it thoroughly using controlled set of experiments\n- Using activation noise at inference time seems novel (I have not seen it before) and likely generally useful\n- The paper also presents an interesting negative result that activation noise is not effective for discriminative modeling.\n\nWeakness\n- Caption for Table 1 can be made more descriptive so that the reader can look at it in a self-contained way.\n- While the phenomena is novel, the most impressive results are obtained using 10^4 samples on all the datasets. I'm unsure as a reader if this has practical benefit even on a moderately larger models than the paper considers. I think at least a discussion how the insights can be used would make the paper stronger.",
  "summary_of_the_paper": "The paper generalizes and studies activation noise for both training and inference for the specific case of energy-based models. Core contributions include 1) using activation noise helping at inference time (typically dropout is not used at inference time) and 2) through study of which pairs of distributions of noise works best at training and inference time "
