Confidence Score: 4

Reasoning: The confidence score of 4 is justified by the similarities between the new paper and the two existing papers in terms of exploring regularization techniques and their impacts on model performance. The first paper discusses activation noise as a form of dropout and its role in enhancing classification accuracy, while the second paper addresses the memorization of noisy labels in DNNs through regularization strategies. 

The new paper extends the concept of dropout to Graph Convolutional Networks, focusing on the structural aspects of regularization and the unique interactions dropout has within a graph context. This thematic connection to dropout and regularization aligns well with the findings in the previous papers, which emphasize the importance of regularization methods in deep learning models. 

Moreover, the new paper's exploration of dropout's degree-dependent effects and its relationship with batch normalization adds a layer of complexity that is consistent with the theoretical analyses present in the other two papers. However, the distinct focus on graph structures and the specific challenges associated with GCNs, such as oversmoothing, makes it somewhat more niche compared to the broader applications discussed in the earlier papers. Hence, while there is strong relevance, the uniqueness of the new paper's contributions leads to a slightly lower confidence score of 4 instead of a full 5.
